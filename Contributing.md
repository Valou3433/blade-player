## Opening an Issue.

Opening issues on Github are a way of drawing the attention of the project maintainer(s). You can open an issue for two major reasons. Either to pitch in an idea(feature request) or, to report a bug. 
Before opening a new issue, browse through the issue tracker if the issue hasn't already been reported by another user. There's a chance that the feature you wish to request for, or, the bug you experienced has already been reported. You can check out closed issues too. With the new features on Github, you can easily know if an issue has been submitted before. You can do this by typing a few words on the title bar and you will get suggestions for similar issues. If you have confirmed that that the issue hasn't been opened before, go ahead and [open an issue](https://github.com/Valou3433/blade-player/issues/new)

### Submitting Feature Requests

If you wish to make contributions with respect to feature requests;

- Please check the issue tracker to ascertain if the feature hasn't already been requested before by another user. If the feature has already been requested, but it is a closed issue that hasn't been marked as "won't fix", feel free to reopen the issue or create yours. 
To request a new feature you should [open an issue](https://github.com/Valou3433/blade-player/issues/new).

**In order to help the developer understand the feature request;**
- Title of the issue should be explicit, giving insight into the content of the issue.
- The area of the project where your feature would be applied or implemented should be properly stated. Add screenshots of mockup if possible.
- It would be great if a detailed use case is included in your request.

When submitting a feature request, please make a single issue for each feature request (i.e. don't submit an issue that contains a list of features). Such issues are hard to keep track of and often get lost.

## Bug & Crash Reports

Did you encounter an error which ultimately led to a crash while using Blade-Player? Let the developer know about it by creating a new issue. 

Filing a great bug report helps the developer pinpoint the cause of the bug and effectively work on a fix.

### Steps on how to file a great bug report.

Before filing a bug report,
- Ensure you're running the latest version of the software
- Confirm if it's actually a bug and not an error caused by a plugin on your system. Test with other systems to verify
- If the same issue persists after testing on other devices then it is indeed a bug.

- Check the issue tracker if the bug hasn't been reported by other users. If it has been reported before it is likely to be in [opened issues](https://github.com/Valou3433/blade-player/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue). Also, check [closed issues](https://github.com/Valou3433/blade-player/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed) too.

The most important aspect of a bug report is the details. The more concise the details, the easier it'll be for the developer or someone else to tackle the bug.

- Title of the issue should give the developer insight about what the report is all about. 
- A brief explanation of the behaviour you expected the software to perform.
- The actual behaviour of the software when you experienced the bug.
- Steps to reproduce the bug coupled with screenshots and videos if possible.
